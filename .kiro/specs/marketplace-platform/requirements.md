# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Marketplace Platform is a self-service online marketplace portal application similar to AWS Marketplace, enabling registered customers and partners to buy and sell software solutions. The platform facilitates transactions between software vendors (partners) and end customers while providing the marketplace owner with commission-based revenue and comprehensive management capabilities.

The platform will be built using modular CDK-based architecture for phased development and deployment, starting with core functionality and expanding incrementally. Payment processing will be handled through Instamojo integration supporting both card and UPI payments.
